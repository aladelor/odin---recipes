    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>500g sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. Coconut Oil</li>
            <li>½ red onion (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>200g tinned chickpeas (drained)</li>
            <li>150g chorizo or pancetta (chopped into 1cm cubes)</li>
            <li>½ tsp. sea salt</li>
            <li>½ tsp. black pepper</li>
            <li>4 medium free-range eggs</li>
            <li>Handful pickled and sliced jalapeños</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5>Directions</h5>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the sweet potatoes and chop into 2cm cubes. 
                Put the cubes into a pan and cover with water, 
                then bring to the boil. Once boiling, drain and 
                allow the steam to run off for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> While waiting, add the coconut oil to a pan on 
                a medium to high heat. Once melted, add the 
                chopped onions and chorizo/pancetta, and fry for
                 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Next, turn the heat down to medium and add the
                 sweet potatoes, chickpeas, jalapenos, sea salt
                  and black pepper. Squash them down a little 
                  and fry for 8-10 minutes without moving them, 
                  until the bottom becomes crispy.</li>
            <li>Once crispy, make 4 small wells in the hash and 
                break in the eggs. Cover the pan with a lid and 
                cook for 2-3 minutes until the eggs are cooked 
                but the yolk is still runny (you can cook for 
                longer if you like your yolks well-done).</li>
            <li> Top with a few extra jalapeños and serve.</li>
        </ol>
