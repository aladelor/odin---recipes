    <h3>The best steak and potatoes recipe you'll ever have - Simple and so flavorful!</h3>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 lb (650g) flank steak, sliced against the grain</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lb (650g) baby yellow potatoes, quartered</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and fresh cracked pepper</li>
            <li>Crushed red chili pepper flakes, optional</li>
            <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce (we used Sriracha)</li>
            <li>Fresh cracked pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5>Directions</h5>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the steak strips with 
                soy sauce, olive oil, pepper, and hot sauce. Set 
                aside to marinate while you cook potatoes.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, 
                mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon 
                butter. When butter is melted, add potatoes. 
                Cook for about 4 minutes, stir and cook an 
                additional 4-5 minutes until potatoes are 
                golden and fork tender. Transfer to a plate 
                and set aside.</li>
            <li>Keep the same skillet over medium heat and add 
                remaining 2 tablespoons butter, garlic, red chili 
                pepper flakes, and fresh herbs. Lay the steak 
                strips in one layer in the skillet, keeping the 
                drained marinade for later. Cook on each side for 
                1 minute each, until nicely browned - adjust timing 
                depending on how you like your steak.</li>
            <li>Right before the steak is done, you can stir in 
                the reserved marinade if you like, and cook for 
                one minute. Add the potatoes back to the pan and 
                heat through. Adjust seasoning with salt and 
                pepper if necessary.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve immediately, garnished
                 with more crushed chili pepper, fresh herbs, and
                  a sprinkle of parmesan cheese over the potatoes
                   if you like. Enjoy!</li>
