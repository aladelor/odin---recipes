    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <h6>Buffalo Sauce</h6>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's)</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Ginger Soy Glaze</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>1 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled, sliced</li>
            <li>3 large garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>¼ cup honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Wings</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>5 pounds chicken wings, tips removed, drumettes and flats separated</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5>Directions</h5>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix butter, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and 
                salt in a medium bowl; let stand 5 minutes. 
                Whisk in hot sauce; keep warm.</li>
            <li>Bring ginger, garlic, honey, soy sauce, and ¼ 
                cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, 
                stirring to dissolve honey. Reduce heat to low;
                 simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced
                  to ¼ cup, 7-8 minutes. Strain into a medium 
                  bowl. Let sit 15 minutes to thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°. Set a wire rack inside 2 large 
                rimmed baking sheets. Toss chicken wings, vegetable oil, 
                salt, and pepper in a large bowl to coat. Divide wings 
                between prepared racks and spread out in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Bake wings until cooked through and skin is crispy, 45-50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Line another rimmed baking sheet with foil; top with a 
                wire rack. Add half of wings to ginger-soy glaze and 
                toss to evenly coat. Place wings in a single layer on 
                prepared rack and bake until glaze is glossy and lightly
                 caramelized, 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Toss remaining half of wings in Buffalo sauce. Serve immediately (no need to bake them).
            </li>
        </ol>
